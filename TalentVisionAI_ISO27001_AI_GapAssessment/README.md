# TalentVisionAI — ISO 27001 & AI Governance Control Gap Assessment

**Role:** GRC / AI Governance Analyst (self-directed portfolio project)  
**Industry:** AI-enabled HR screening and candidate ranking  
**Frameworks:** ISO 27001:2022, ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management System reference), NIST AI RMF, GDPR (profiling), EU AI Act draft

## Project Overview
TalentVisionAI is a fictional SaaS platform that uses machine learning models to support HR teams by screening candidate CVs, scoring candidate-job fit, and recommending shortlists to hiring managers. The system processes personal and sensitive data, including names, employment history, and candidate assessments.

This project simulates:
- an ISO 27001:2022 control gap assessment,
- an AI governance gap assessment based on ISO/IEC 42001 & NIST AI RMF,
- identification of bias, fairness, transparency, and explainability risks,
- and a risk-aligned remediation plan combining traditional and AI-specific controls.

## Deliverables
- `scope.md` — ISMS & AI governance scope definition
- `annexA-gap-analysis.xlsx` — ISO 27001 control maturity view
- `ai-governance-gap-analysis.xlsx` — AI governance & fairness control maturity view
- `statement-of-applicability.md` — applicability & justification
- `remediation-roadmap.md` — combined security + AI readiness roadmap

## What this demonstrates
- Understanding of ISO 27001 in an AI product context  
- Ability to apply ISO/IEC 42001 & NIST AI RMF concepts to real business risks  
- Identification of privacy, fairness & explainability challenges in AI systems  
- Practical remediation recommendations that align to emerging regulations (EU AI Act)

This project represents capabilities expected of future-facing **GRC, AI Risk, and Emerging Tech Governance analysts**.
