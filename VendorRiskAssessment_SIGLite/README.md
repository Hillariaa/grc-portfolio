# Vendor Risk Assessment — SIG Lite (Portfolio Project)

This project demonstrates practical vendor risk management capability using a SIG Lite–style questionnaire and risk evaluation methods. The focus is third-party SaaS vendors that process personal, financial, or operationally sensitive data relevant to TalentVisionAI and general GRC practices.

## Vendors Assessed
1. Greenhouse — Applicant Tracking System (ATS) & HR platform
2. Stripe — Payment processor and financial data handler *(coming next)*

## Deliverables
- Vendor inventory
- Completed SIG Lite questionnaire
- Evidence-based responses sourced from public documentation
- Risk scoring & report with remediation recommendations

## Methodology
The assessment follows a modified SIG Lite structure:
- Governance
- Risk Management
- Security
- Privacy & Data Handling
- Availability & Continuity
- Vendor Dependencies

Scoring:
- 0 = Not Present
- 1 = Weak
- 2 = Partially Meets Expectations
- 3 = Meets Expectations
- 4 = Exceeds Expectations

Risk factors consider:
- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)
- Privacy risks (GDPR/PII)
- Operational continuity
- Dependency risks

## Output
Each vendor evaluation includes:
- Questionnaire responses
- Documented evidence sources
- Observed risks
- Recommended mitigations
- Final risk rating
