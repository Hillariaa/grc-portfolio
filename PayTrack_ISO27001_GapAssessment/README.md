# PayTrack – ISO 27001:2022 Control Gap Assessment

**Role:** GRC / Information Security Analyst (self-directed project)  
**Industry:** SaaS payroll (EU-based, scaling startup)  
**Frameworks:** ISO 27001:2022, NIST CSF (mapping), SOC 2 (readiness alignment)

## Project Overview

PayTrack is a fictional mid-stage SaaS payroll provider used by small and medium EU businesses to manage salaries, benefits, and tax calculations. The platform processes:

- Employee PII (names, addresses, contact details)
- Financial data (salary, bank account details)
- Tax identifiers and employment records

The organization is preparing for ISO 27001 certification and SOC 2 Type 1 readiness to support expansion into regulated markets and international customers.

This project simulates a **formal ISO 27001:2022 control gap assessment** for PayTrack and produces:

- A scoped description of the ISMS boundary
- A high-level asset and process view
- Annex A control gap ratings (Implemented / Partially Implemented / Not Implemented / Not Applicable)
- A draft Statement of Applicability (SoA)
- A remediation roadmap prioritised by risk

## Files in this project

- `scope.md` – ISMS scope, context, assumptions
- `annexA-gap-analysis.xlsx` – control-by-control gap view (to be added)
- `statement-of-applicability.xlsx` – applicability and justification (to be added)
- `remediation-roadmap.md` – prioritised actions with owners and timelines (to be added)

## What this demonstrates

- Ability to **apply ISO 27001:2022 in a SaaS environment**
- Understanding of **risk-based control selection**
- Practical experience with **gap assessments, SoA drafting, and remediation planning**
- Clear, structured documentation suitable for stakeholders and auditors
